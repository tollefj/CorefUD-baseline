class MentionDict:
    """Dictionary indexed by `Mention` objects that, unlike a standard dictionary, allows for retrieving values that are indexed
    by the key mentions which match the query mention only fuzzilly.

    For calculating coreference evaluation scores, key clusters must be searched if they contain a sys mention (or vice versa).
    For efficiency reasons, the key clusters to be searched were implemented as dictionaries of cluster IDs indexed by mentions.
    The search in `coval/eval/evaluation.py` is then performed by `if sys_mention in key_mention2clusterid`, running the dict's
    `__contains__` operator. Default behaviour of the operator is that if first calculates a hash of the query and fails if no
    key in the dictionary has the same hash.

    Nevertheless, this is unwanted behaviour if the dictionary is required to support fuzzy matching of its keys with the query.
    A naive, yet inefficient solution, would be to implement `key_mention2clusterid` as a list of key-value pairs, performing
    the fuzzy match in O(n) time.

    `MentionDict` class takes advantage of the fact that the fuzzy matching between two mentions is based on set-subset relations.
    Internally, all mentions used as keys in `MentionDict` are stored in the `_word2mention` dict of lists indexed by words that
    mentions consist of. For a given query mention `qm`, search in the MentionDict `D` then proceeds in two steps:
        1. fuzzy search of `qm` among the keys in `D`, getting no result or a key mention `km`
            - go through all words `qw` in `qm` and using the `D._word2mention` indexed by words find the best matching mention
              `km` that contains `qw` and fuzzily matches `qm`
        2. retrieving the cluster ID value associated with `km`
            - having obtained `km`, we can use exact matching of a standard dictionary to retrieve the value
